# Classic Arcade Game Clone

## Instructions

Welcome to the Classic Arcade Game Clone! 

The game begins with a player and enemy bugs. As the player, your job is to make it to the other side of the water without colliding with the bugs. To move your player use the arrow keys (up, down, left, and right). Once your player collides with a bug, it will return to its starting position. The game is won once the player outsmarts those tricky little bugs and reaches the water. To play again, simply move your player or refresh the page. 

Good luck!

## Installation
